This release and future minor releases will be focused on getting a initial design spec and a drop-in replacement-esque status with the `RGiesecke.DLLExport`.
Once we have a solid base, we will bump to v1 without any breaking changes from the last v0.X release.

* #13 Fixed export writing task confusing success and failure (Thanks, @filmor)
